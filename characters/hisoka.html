                <h2 id="contentstart">Hisoka Morow</h2>
                <p>Hisoka Morow (ãƒ’ã‚½ã‚«ã‚ ãƒ¢ãƒ­ã‚¦, Hisoka Morou) is a Hunter and former member #4 of the Phantom Troupe; his physical strength ranked third in the group. He is always in search for strong opponents, and would spare those who have great potential,
                    such as Gon and Killua in order for them to get strong enough to actually challenge him. He originally served as the primary antagonist of the Hunter Exam arc and a secondary one of the Heavens Arena arc, before becoming a supporting
                    character during the Yorknew City arc and Greed Island arc. During the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, he briefly reprises his role as a secondary antagonist.</p>

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Hisoka's appearance is similar to that of a magician or jester. He is tall and has light skin and a very muscular physique. His attire is usually adorned with various suit symbols (â™¦/â™¦ â™£/â™£ â™¥/â™¥ â™ /â™ ) on the front and back torso, and he changes
                    outfits in each story arc. He wears face paint of a star (â˜…) on his right cheek and a teardrop (ðŸ’§) on his left cheek, and like his attire, in the 2011 anime, his face paint also occasionally changes colors. During the Greed Island
                    arc, Hisoka wears the Greed Island Ring on his left middle finger. And in the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, Hisoka wears a pair of earrings with ornamental hearts. For unknown reasons, Hisoka has long, pointed nails, giving his
                    hands a claw-like appearance, hinting at his sinister nature. In his first appearance in the 1999 anime series, Hisoka's hair is blue. After a revamp of the show, it was replaced with a red or almost neon pink color to be in accordance
                    with the manga. In the 2011 anime, Hisoka has red hair and light amber eyes. In the manga, during the Yorknew City arc, Hisoka dyes his hair light green. These dynamic variations in appearance illustrate the complexity of his character.</p>
